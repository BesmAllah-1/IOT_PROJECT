# IOT_PROJECT
This project is as simple as a Remote Heart Rate Monitoring System using RemoteXY cloud service.
It maybe used for patients monitoring in intensive care inside hospitals or clinics.
This will allow doctors or medical crew, in general, to move around easily with a guaranteed method of monitoring patients' state.
